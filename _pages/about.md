Hello! I am a fourth-year undergraduate student from [College of Physics and Optoelectronic Engineering](https://cpoe.szu.edu.cn/en/), [Shenzhen University](https://en.szu.edu.cn/). Now I am working on Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM) with Prof. [An Pan](http://www.piclaboratory.com/), Xi'an institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics of CAS. My research interest lies in computational imaging, biophotonics and deep learning. I previously worked on fluorescence imaging with Prof. [Xiao Peng](https://bpg.szu.edu.cn/index.htm), Shenzhen University. <a href="https://clustrmaps.com/site/1bx47" title="Visit tracker">

## Fusion protein localization predicted by Alphafold2

**Abstract**: Currently, rapid and accurate prediction of targeting expression of a fluorescent protein tagged fusion protein remains a great challenge. Molecular docking simulation method have been widely used to predict molecular binding targets in former studies. However, such prediction methods depend on the existing protein structures and existed structural predictions, leading to an unsatisfied accuracy. Here, we combine Alphafold2 with molecular docking simulations to predict the targeting effect of fluorescent protein EGFP or mCherry fused to cytoskeleton protein. The prediction results showed that the fusion of mCherry with beta-actin did not affect its expression in the cytoskeleton; By contrast, the fusion of EGFP with beta-actin inhibited its efficient participation in the formation of the cytoskeleton. Subsequently, the corresponding actin-mCherry and actin-EGFP expression vectors were constructed for transfection into cells. The transfected cells were observed under a convert microscope. The imaging results showed that actin-mCherry participated in the construction of the cytoskeleton, while actin-EGFP dispersed in the cytoplasm. This work can predict whether the fusion of fluorescent protein and target protein will affect its original targeting function, and provides a new method for further optimizing the design of fusion proteins.
