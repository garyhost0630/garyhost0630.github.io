We are committed to solving [Problem E: Forestry for Carbon Sequestration](/icm.pdf). For our full paper, you can click [here](/icm_fullpaper.pdf).

## Abstract:

As the problem of global warming intensifies, the impact of climate change on life is increasing, and forests play an indispensable role in mitigating climate change. In this pa-per, we measure the total amount of carbon sequestration in forests, then we evaluate and predict carbon sequestration after considering other factors, to give the most reasonable management decision-making suggestions.

First, we built a **carbon sequestration model**. In this model, taking into account the species and age of trees, we calculated forest carbon sequestration and forest product carbon sequestration separately. By calculating the total carbon sequestration amount through inte-gration, we can find the cutting time of various types of trees. Cutting at or after this time yields more carbon sequestration than if the trees were not cut. Then, we calculated the car-bon sequestration of forests in China through the model and then compared the results with the actual data, verifying the validity of the model.

Secondly, taking into account the other values of the forest, we build decision models to inform forest managers of the best use of a forest. In the model, we take into account five indicators: biodiversity, productive capacity, health vitality, carbon sequestration, and eco-nomic benefits. The **grey relational analysis model** is used to evaluate the above indica-tors, and determine the priority of each indicator in decision-making. To minimize the tran-sition time for each of the forest metrics, we use a **mathematical programming model** to find the best management options for each forest. After applying the best management plan, we used the **grey prediction model GM(1,1)** improved by **combined weight method** to predict the carbon sequestration of forests and their products within 100 years.

Furthermore, we apply the decision model to two forests in China, the Great Khingan in the cold temperate zone and the Xishuangbanna rainforest in the tropical rainforest cli-mate. As for Great Khingan, we first used gray correlation analysis to get the priority of each indicator, and the result showed that the priority of fire rate was the highest. Then, us-ing mathematical programming, the most suitable transition point for the forest is 17% of the correlation degree of each index, and the shortest time required to reach the transition point is 19.4 years. Finally, we predict that the total carbon sequestration in the Great Khin-gan Mountains from 2000 to 2100 is 143735.3297 million tons by GM(1,1). As for Xishuangbanna Tropical Rainforest, we use the same way to calculate. Results show that biomass and carbon sequestration has the highest priority, the transition point is 12% of the correlation degree of each indicator, and the shortest time required to reach the transition point is 9.7 years. The total carbon sequestration from 2000 to 2100 was 129,590.2157 mil-lion tons. 

Finally, we analyze the sensibility of our model and point out our strengths and weak-nesses. Analysis indicates that the Greater Khingan is most sensitive to changes in fire rates and the Xishuangbanna rainforest is most sensitive to changes in tourism.
