Hello! I am a fourth year undergraduate student from [College of Physics and Optoelectronic Engineering](https://cpoe.szu.edu.cn/en/), [Shenzhen University](https://en.szu.edu.cn/). Now I am working on Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM) with Prof. [An Pan](http://www.piclaboratory.com/). My research interest lies in biomedical imaging, silicon photonics and optics. I previously worked on fluorescence imaging with Prof. [Xiao Peng](https://bpg.szu.edu.cn/index.htm).
